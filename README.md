**PREDICTION USING DECISION TREE ALGORITHM**


**Task:** Prediction using Decision Tree

**Objective:** To predict the right class if we feed any new data to the classifier.

**Dataset link:** https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

**Dataset Characteristic:**
sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, species

**About:**
Firstly I found sepal dimensions and petal dimensions using scatterplot. Then found correlation between dependent and independent variables. and then build decision tree model. And found accurracy of the model.
